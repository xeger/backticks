  # An easy-to-use interface for invoking commands and capturing their output.
  # Instances of Runner can be interactive, which prints the command's output
  # to the terminal and also allows the user to interact with the command.
  # They can also be unbuffered, which uses a pseudo-tty to capture the
  # command's output with no delay or
  class Runner
    # If true, commands will have their stdio streams tied to the parent
    # process so the user can view their output and send input to them.
    # Commands' output is still captured normally when they are interactive.
    #
    # Note that interactivity doesn't work very well with unbuffered commands;
    # we use pipes to connect to the command's stdio, and the OS forcibly
    # buffers pipe I/O. If you want to send some input to your command, you
    # may need to send a LOT of input before it receives any; the same problem
    # applies to reading your command's output. If you set interactive to
    # true, you usually want to set buffered to false!

    # to capture output as it is generated instead of waiting for pipe buffers
    # to fill.
